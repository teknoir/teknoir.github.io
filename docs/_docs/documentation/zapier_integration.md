# Zapier Integration

In order to integrate DevStudio with Zapier you should use the partner app Teknoir Operational AI Apps.

To help in configuring Zaps, there is a custom node-red plugin (https://github.com/teknoir/node-red-teknoir-zapier) that can be installed which will provide two nodes that generate the URLs required for Zap integration.

## Triggers

**New Event**: Adding this trigger will get events from DevStudio and pass them to the next step in a Zap, usually a notification app like Slack or Teams.

You only need to provide a NodeURL like `https://teknoir.dev/devstudio/namespace-example/devstudio-instance-name/_zap/trigger/abcdefg1234567890`

The NodeURL will be generated by the custom DevStudio Zapier node.

## Actions
- **Create Event**: Adding this action will allow you to send messages to a specific node in DevStudio.

To configure a Zap to send messages to DevStudio, you will need to provide the following information:

| Type         | Label      | Key      | Requirements                 |
|--------------|------------|----------|------------------------------|
| Input Field  | Node URL   | nodeurl  | Must be a valid URL string   |
| Input Field  | Topic      | topic    | Must be a string             |
| Input Field  | Payload    | payload  | Usually a JSON   |

The NodeURL will be generated by the custom DevStudio Zapier node.
